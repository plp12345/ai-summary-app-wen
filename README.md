## Overview

Agentic Coding agents allows users to generate thousands of lines of code and build complex features without fully understanding how the code works.  While AI can easily complete the first 70% of a platform, what truly differentiates us is our understanding of the AI-generated code or solutions, which may appear correct on the surface but can contain inefficient or flawed logic underneath. Our ability to debug and fix these problems ourselves, especially in the final 30% where AI struggles, is what sets us apart. In the age of AI, it is still important to learn the foundational skills of building applications step-by-step. 

In this tutorial, we will 
 - Build an AI Summary App using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. The app will allow users to upload documents, preview their content, and generate AI-powered summaries. 
 - You will also learn how to develop your own customized tutorials using AI to learn new technology effectively.

## Learning objectives

- Develop a practical understanding of building a modern web app with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.
- Gain experience working collaboratively with AI tools, learning when and how to trust, verify, and improve AI-generated code.
- Understand the concept and usage of GitHub Copilot Agent Skills to customize and extend AI capabilities.
- Practice version control and collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.
- Learn how to develop customized learning contents as a method of consolidating knowledge learnt and develop valuable resource to revisit later to improve understanding.


### Task 1: Build a simple Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and document your steps 
Tech Stack:
- Next.js is a popular React framework that enables developers to build fast, user-friendly web applications with features like server-side rendering and static site generation. Many Vibe Coding platform projects use Next.js as the primary framework for building web applications. 
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces without writing extensive custom CSS.

Complete the steps to create a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS as described in part 1 of the tutorial.
 - The tutorial is written in Markdown format. In VS Code, you can preview the file by right-clicking it and selecting **Open Preview**.
 - While working through the steps, capture and insert the required screenshots into the tutorial.
 - If you encounter any concepts or code snippets you don’t understand, ask the AI agent for explanations. You can also improve the tutorial by adding more detailed explanations, which will enhance your learning and provide a useful reference for future review.

Commit your changes regularly and push them to your GitHub repository.


### Task 2: Generate part 2 of the tutorial using Copilot Agent Mode
The GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is not only useful in generating code, but also specification, documentation, tutorial  and teach us new concepts. One useful feature is that we can generate customized step-by-step tutorial to assist us to learn new technology or framework.  

Steps:
1. Use the Copilot Agent Mode to assist in creating a tutorial for the part 2 of the tutorial in this repository. 
    - Review and try the steps and correct any mistakes or missing steps/explanation if any. 
    - Learn the concepts you don't know along the way using AI.

2. Improve the tutorial
    - Insert relevant screenshots to improve the clarity of the tutorial
    - By default, the AI agent may just generate a basic tutorial. It may miss important explanation, fails to explain the conceps in a simple way, miss important steps, etc. Please revise the  tutorial and improve the explanation to make it easy to understand and useful for someone even who is new to the technology to learn from the tutorial. 
    - You may either manually improve the tutorial or ask the AI agent to help you improve the tutorial. You can use the Copilot completion feature to provide suggestions of the learning content. To enable the auto-completion in markdown documents in VSCode, go to Settings > Extensions > Search for **github.copilot.enable** > Enable the Auto-Completion for markdown.


Commit your changes regularly and push them to your GitHub repository.


### Important Notes/Tips
- Don't just let the AI agent complete all the step. If you do so, you will miss the opportunity to learn and understand the concepts behind. You should try the steps one by one to make sure you understand the foundation. 
- The AI agent may not always generate perfect code or documentation. 
    - Always review and test the generated content to ensure it meets your requirements. 
    - Update your tutorial when the tutorial steps are not accurate or miss important explanation.
- Debug and Refactoring
    - When encountering bugs you want the AI agent to help fix, provide relevant information such as error messages, terminal logs, browser console logs, and platform logs (e.g., Vercel).
    - While implementing your app, you can use AI to help refactor and modularize the code into multiple files to improve its reusability and maintainability.
